			<p>One of my semester projects in college was to create an illustration that best desribes you in three words. The words that I had chosen for this assignment was "Metal", "Loud", and "Techie".</p>
			<br>
			<p>I had chosen the word "Metal" for the simple fact that I do enjoy listening to metal music on my commutes to work or when I'm out doing errands, "Loud" because, well, I'm loud and always out there to start a conversation, and lastly "Technie" because I'm a geek and have always been. I love technology and coding. It's why I do what I do.</p>
